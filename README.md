# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game created using Python's tkinter library. Players alternate turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
